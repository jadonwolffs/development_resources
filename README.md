# Development Resources

### *A bunch of resources I found helpful in either learning new development skills or actual reference during development*

## General skills
- [Markdown](./markdown/readme.md)
- [Git](./git/readme.md)

### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
Stack Overflow is a great forum style Q&A site which is a great place to call on others knowledge to solve a problem. It is always good practice to try search for an issue and someone else's solution to it rather than asking a new question or giving up.

## Web apps

- [NodeJS](./node/readme.md)

- [ReactJS](./react/readme.md) - one of the main big frameworks for web dev

- [Django](./django/readme.md)

- [TypeScript](./typescript/readme.md)
- [CSS](./css/readme.md)

### Utilities
[XML sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) - a utility which scans for dead links and creates a map of a site

## Local apps
### C++ 

- [Rust](./rust/readme.md)

- [Python](./python/readme.md)

- [Java](./java/readme.md)

## Servers
### Linux

Just choose a distro and learn it

## Deploying various apps

- [Heroku](./deployement/heroku/readme.md)

- [Firebase](./deployement/firebase/readme.md)
