# Development Resources

### *A bunch of resources I found helpful in either learning new development skills or actual reference during development*

## General skills
- [Markdown](./markdown)
- [Git](./git)

### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
Stack Overflow is a great forum style Q&A site which is a great place to call on others knowledge to solve a problem. It is always good practice to try search for an issue and someone else's solution to it rather than asking a new question or giving up.

## Web apps

- [NodeJS](./node)

- [ReactJS](./react) - one of the main big frameworks for web dev

- [Preact](./preact) - compact react alternative

- [Django](./django)

- [TypeScript](./typescript)
- [CSS](./css)

### Utilities
[XML sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) - a utility which scans for dead links and creates a map of a site
[Color scheme](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/color-scheme.html)

## Local apps
### C++ 

- [Rust](./rust)

- [Python](./python)

- [Java](./java)

## Servers
### Linux

Just choose a distro and learn it

## Deploying various apps
