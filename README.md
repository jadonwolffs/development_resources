# Development Resources

### *A bunch of resources I found helpful in either learning new development skills or actual reference during development*

## General skills
### Markdown
[GitHub Flavoured Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
GFM is very useful for making quick and easily styled informative READMEs such as this one
### Git
Super important skill used for both collaboration in teams and version control when working alone. Connecting the git program to GitHub or another hosting service allows for easy incremental syncing between workstations and users.
Install via [this page for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or using ```sudo apt install git``` or ```sudo yum install git``` on Linux based systems. There is a graphical client available too these days.

### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
Stack Overflow is a great forum style Q&A site which is a great place to call on others knowledge to solve a problem. It is always good practice to try search for an issue and someone else's solution to it rather than asking a new question or giving up.
## Web apps

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

A JavaScript runtime designed for scalable web apps. It forms the basis of tons of other packages and frameworks like React

### [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
React is a JavaScript predominantly client side which require some sort of restful backend to communicate with for most apps
[The Complete Guide To React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) - this course covers quite a decent array of relevant aspects of React and even some Firebase as a rest backend

### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python)
Django is a python based server side web hosting framework to serve html pages to users
### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets - used to style HTML components ('Cascading' because children can inherit styles)
#### Cheatsheets
[Spinners in HTML and CSS](https://loading.io/css/)

#### [Taliwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
A fantastic way of assigning customisable CSS classes to components rather than having to style things manually.

### Utilities
[XML sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) - a utility which scans for dead links and creates a map of a site

## Local apps
### C++ 

### [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (through cargo)
[Traversy Media intro course](https://youtu.be/zF34dRivLOw)
Rust is a very powerful speed oriented language with some support for web development but mainly aimed at writing backend apps. It doesn't have as steep a learning curve but for certain applications it has comparable performance but it also has the added benefit of doing some memory management automatically

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)



### [Java](https://www.java.com/)
There are countless resources for Java out there but unless one of the other languages here cannot solve your problem then my personal is to use something else. Java has some important pros but for most fairly straightforward problems something like Python is probably more suitable.

## Servers
### Linux

Just choose a distro and learn it

## Deploying various apps
### Heroku
[heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
Heroku is a free app hosting service that functions simillarly to a simple git remote repo so that you can deploy to it just by pushing new git commits. It supports various different languages (Node.js, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure) and for some situations no configuration is even neccessary as Heroku automatically sets it up and deploys. Detailed docs are available [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
