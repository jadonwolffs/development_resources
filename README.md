# Development Resources

### *A bunch of resources I found helpful in either learning new development skills or actual reference during development*


## General skills

### Markdown
[GitHub Flavoured Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
GFM Markdown is very useful for making quick and easily styled informative READMEs such as this one

### Git
Super important skill

## Web apps

### React JS

[The Complete Guide To React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) - this course covers quite a decent array of relevant aspects of React and even 


### Django (Python)

[Spinners in HTML and CSS](https://loading.io/css/)

## Local apps

### C++ 

### Rust (through cargo)
[Traversy Media intro course](https://youtu.be/zF34dRivLOw)
Rust is a very powerful speed oriented language with some support for web development but mainly aimed at writing backend apps. It doesn't have as steep a learning curve but for certain applications it has comparable performance but it also has the added benefit of doing some memory management automatically

### Python



note on Java

## Servers

### Linux

## Deploying various apps
### Heroku
[heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
Heroku is a free app hosting service that functions simillarly to a simple git remote repo so that you can deploy to it just by pushing new git commits. It supports various different languages (Node.js, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure) and for some situations no configuration is even neccessary as Heroku automatically sets it up and deploys. Detailed docs are available [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
